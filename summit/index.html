			<h1>Radically Reshaping the Future of Mobile Information Creation, Access and Sharing</h1>
			<p>This one-day Summit event aims to think disruptively and imaginatively about what the future might bring for emergent mobile users over the next five to ten years. By emergent users, we mean people who are either only just getting access to advanced mobile devices or who will potentially do so in the next few years (see <a href="#emergent-users">[1]</a>).</p>
			<p>We’ll be considering the devices, services, content, interfaces and interactions that could transform uptake and benefits within these communities. We will also be thinking about what this fresh thinking might mean for “rest of the world” users, and whether there are overlooked alternatives to the orthodoxy of current platforms.</p>
			<p>Together, attendees will assess and critique current technologies and future visions, creating a series of new concepts, design provocations and innovations that will be distilled into inspiring videos by a group of videographers. All of this data will be shared fully with participants after the event.</p>
			<p>Our team will use the outputs of the day along with insights from emergent user groups in Cape Town, Nairobi and Mumbai to develop a series of open-source prototypes that will be deployed next year</p>
