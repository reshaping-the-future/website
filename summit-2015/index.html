			<h1>Radically Reshaping the Future of Mobile Information Creation, Access and Sharing</h1>
			<p>This two-day Summit event aims to think disruptively and imaginatively about what the future might bring for Base-of-Pyramid mobile users over the next five to ten years. We’ll be considering the devices, services, content, interfaces and interactions that could transform uptake and benefits within these communities. We will also be thinking about what this fresh thinking might mean for “rest of the world” users, and whether there are overlooked alternatives to the orthodoxy of current platforms.</p>
			<p>Together, attendees will create a series of probes, concepts, design provocations and innovations that will be distilled by the second day of the event. Our team will then present a selection of these to stakeholders and users to garner initial reactions and suggestions that will help us develop a series of locally designed and deployed prototypes.</p>
